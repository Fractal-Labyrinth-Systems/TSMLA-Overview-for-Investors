## What TSMLA™ Is
TSMLA™ (Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture) is a novel **resonance-physics logic mirror**.  
It shows where your statements align, conflict, or loop, using math, not opinion. It's logic architecture that mirrors statements, classifies contradiction types, and scores coherence using tag-weighted math. 

## What It Does

- Takes your declared state **S** (what you say)
- Maps it into a structured mirror
- Highlights contradictions and recursion traps
- Scores coherence so you can act with clarity
- Produces **audit-grade, repeatable reflections,** non-stochastic and idempotent under **S** (results change when **S** changes)

### What It’s Not

- Not a chatbot or therapy/wellness tool
- Not generative or predictive AI
- Not trained to imitate users

## Why This Is New
- New class: mirror-grade logic engine (not generative or predictive)
- Original math stack (Boolean logic, entropy modeling, recursive mapping) + proprietary layers (BDL™, HCL™, RSF™) unified in       one architecture
- Idempotent outputs: stable reflections under declared state S
- Defensibility: provisional patents filed; prior-art scan indicates no equivalent

## Why It Matters
People (and teams) often hold **conflicting instructions** inside their language. That conflict delays action and drives bad choices.  
TSMLA™ presents a clean mirror so you can see the structure and make a decision.  
**No coaching. No diagnosis. Just the structure.**

## Modular System (Unbounded)
Launch set: **75–100 mirror modules** across everyday decision edges.  
The module library is **infinite by design**: new mirrors can be added for any domain.

## Phases (locked)
- **Phase 1: Beta (pre-AI):** Core engine + 75–100 mirror modules (logic/rule based)
- **Phase 2: AI Integration + API:** Adaptive input translation and a hardened API; front-end only; backend stays TSMLA; enables API licensing.
- **Phase 3: Fractal Probability Rendering™ (FPR™):** Mirror-based trajectory rendering (not prediction)
- **Phase 4: Timeline Evolution™:** Resonance-weighted alignment across time
- **Phase 5: Advanced Functions:** Deferred layers (e.g., **CAPF™:** Contrast-Adaptive Perception Function: optional gain-control layer that normalizes tag-weight contrast to keep mirrors stable across dense or low-signal inputs (non-stochastic, idempotent under S)).

**Separate track (not a phase):** **Mirrorfield™:** a standalone, immersive/gamified implementation powered by TSMLA™ (no win condition; ethics-bound).

## Applications and Licensing

**Everyday systems (consumer licensing):**  
- Dating apps to mirror self-presentation vs. choice contradictions  
- Personal decision apps that analyze move, career, and finance choices  
- Consumer AI assistants to check command/goal consistency before action  
- Collaboration tools that evaluate priority–task coherence

**Institutional integrations (API licensing):**  
- Jury selection / voir dire systems to map statement–bias coherence  
- Education, logic reflection, and contradiction auditing in coursework  
- Finance, policy/portfolio coherence checks before approval  
- Technology platforms for contradiction auditing inside existing pipelines (via API), without exposing proprietary TSMLA™ layers

## Monetization
- **Consumer subscriptions:** tiered access to module libraries
- **Enterprise licensing:** API, private deployment + support/SLA; optional SDK (post-API)
- **Paid pilots (NDA):** evaluation licenses; vertical module licensing

Detailed monetization map (pricing, unit economics, and GTM models) is available in the private investor deck under NDA.

## Funding Pathways (non-dilutive + dilutive)

**Non-dilutive (grants & contracts)**
- **NSF SBIR/Seed** (Phase I/II):  research + proto build
- **NIH/ED/DOE SBIR** (fit-dependent): logic/education/verification
- **State innovation grants & R&D tax credits:** bridge + offsets
- **Foundation/Philanthropic tech funds:** category creation, decision integrity
- **University/Consortium pilots (sponsored research):** gated data rooms under NDA

**Strategic & revenue-tied**
- **Paid pilots under NDA:**  evaluation licenses with milestone fees
- **Design partnerships:**  co-funded module development (field-specific mirrors)
- **Corporate innovation budgets:**  API trials; private deployments (support/SLA)

**Dilutive (as needed)**
- **Pre-seed/Seed venture:**  team + Phase-1 buildout
- **Strategic equity:**  select partners aligned with TSMLA’s IP guardrails

> Goal: Maximize non-dilutive and revenue-tied financing first; use equity only where it accelerates the R&D team and Phase-2 API readiness.

## Go-to-Market (initial)
- Public one-pager + white paper (qualify interest)
- Targeted API pilots with 1–2 partners (Phase 2)
- Consumer beta with first 75–100 modules; price/retention testing
- Strict public/NDA split (no core logic disclosed)

## IP & Status
- Provisional filings: TSMLA™, BDL™, Hallway/CTC™ (core logic retained as trade secret)
- Technical Manual (public TOC excerpt) + White Paper published
- Additional artifacts **NDA-gated**; R&D team formation in progress
